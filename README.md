### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steven Viedman, a software engineer from :sunny: Colombia

I'm a full-stack developer :man_technologist: specializing in React, Node.js, Golang, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I love solving problems with computers. I currently work at the  Innovation Labs of project44 building innovative products that improve supply chain visibility and in my free time, I like playing with the TSP problem (and others) on Golang trying to come up with something useful.

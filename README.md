### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steven Viedman, a software engineer from :sunny: Colombia

I'm a full-stack developer :man_technologist: specializing in React, Node.js, Golang, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I love solving problems with computers. I currently work at the  Innovation Labs of project44 building innovative products that improve supply chain visibility and in my free time, I build a Golang library for solving the TSP problem with well-known algorithms.
